It's a project that made with js to search books and manage it based on the current state if it "books that you want to read","books that you already done reading it","books that you are reading currently" 

## What You're Getting

the project is searching in over 1000 of books based on categories spicified in the search terms file . 
so you can discover and manage the book that you want with fast and clear path


## TL;DR

To get started right away:
* clone the project
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Important

-website searching ability is limited so you should take search terms in consideration.
-website is created for learning reason so we are not giving our focus to the style and website looking.
it's all about functionality
